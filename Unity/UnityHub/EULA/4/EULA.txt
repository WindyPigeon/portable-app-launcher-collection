Unity Terms of Service
Last updated: September 13, 2022
Effective: October 13, 2022
What's new as of September 13, 2022?
We have posted an update to our Terms of Service, effective October 13, 2022, to create a more streamlined, user-friendly set of terms that reflect the current state of the Unity Create business, most notably with respect to your Unity account, your use of our offerings, confidentiality, governing law and dispute resolution, and compliance.
These Terms apply to your account with Unity and to our Offerings and constitute a binding contract between you and the Unity Contracting Party. These Terms are effective as of October 22, 2022. The current version of our Terms of Service is available at unity.com/legal/terms-of-service-legacy. Capitalized terms are defined in these Terms, including in the Definitions section below.
1. Eligibility
You must be at least the age to consent to processing of your personal data in your country of residence (e.g., 13 in the US, 16 in the EU, no minimum age in AUNZ, etc.) and comply with all eligibility conditions as set forth by Unity in the Documentation for an Offering or otherwise on the Site and as verified by Unity or Unity’s third party partners to Purchase Educational Versions. You must be at least 18 years old to make Purchases or submit User Content to Unity. If you are under the age of 18, or under whatever is the age of legal majority where you access the Offerings, you may only Purchase (or make purchases or sales through) the Offerings with the authorization of your legal guardian, and you and your legal guardian represent and warrant that you and your legal guardian have read, understood and agreed to these Terms. You represent and warrant that: (a) you have the legal capacity to agree to the Terms; (b) you are not located in a country embargoed by the United States and that you are not on the U.S. Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals; and (c) you will comply with all applicable laws and regulations in connection with your use of the Services (including but not limited to applicable Federal Trade Commission rules and COPPA), and in accordance with the terms and conditions specified in the Terms.
2. Acceptance
By accepting these Terms during your account registration, your Purchase process, or while using the Offerings, you accept and agree to these Terms and to be a party to this binding contract. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not Purchase or use our Offerings.
You agree to these Terms on behalf of the company or other legal entity for which you are acting (for example, as an employee or contractor) or, if you are not acting on behalf of a company or other legal entity, on behalf of yourself as an individual. “You” refers to the entity or individual that is a party to these Terms. You represent and warrant that you have the right, authority, and capacity (for example, you are of sufficient legal age) to act on behalf of and bind such entity (if any) and yourself.
3. Additional Terms; Commercial Terms
Certain Offerings are subject to additional terms (“Additional Terms”). Additional Terms are set forth in the Additional Terms page located at unity.com/legal/additional-terms, which supplement and are incorporated into these Terms, or in the Documentation, Offering Identification or Policies for the Offering. You agree to the Additional Terms, if any, for an Offering that you Purchase or use.
In addition, you may have an additional agreement with a Unity entity that supplements, amends, supersedes or replaces these Terms (for example, an enterprise business agreement) (“Commercial Terms”).
4. Right of Return or Refund
All sales are final and no refunds will be allowed except as required by law.
5. Your Account
To access and/or use most Offerings, you must register for a “Unity Account”. To create a Unity Account, you will be required to provide certain information and you will either establish a username and a password or login with a Unity-approved authentication method. Your account is accessible at https://id.unity.com/ or at another site as designated by Unity. Each account is associated with one or more “Unity Organizations”, and the owner of a Unity Organization may add you to their Unity Organization, which will allow you with access to Offerings that we provide to such Unity Organization.
You are responsible for anyone who Purchases or uses Offerings through you or your Unity Account or Unity Organization, and any act or omission of any such person that is not in compliance with these Terms will constitute an act or omission by you. In certain cases, Authorized Users may be required to set up individual accounts or agree to applicable terms in order to Purchase Offerings, but you remain responsible for all activity that occurs via your Unity Account or within your Unity Organization. You are responsible for safeguarding your password, and you may not disclose your password to any third party. You will immediately notify Unity of any unauthorized use of your account or the accounts of Authorized Users.
Any information you provide to us must be accurate, current and complete, and you will update such information to keep it accurate, current and complete, and Unity may suspend or terminate your Unity Account in accordance with these Terms if any information you provide to us proves to be inaccurate, not current or incomplete.
You may close your account at any time, provided that you have paid any and all remaining amounts owed to Unity beforehand, by sending an email to support@unity3d.com, by submitting a request at <Linked Support Requests> or by reaching out to your Unity account manager, if applicable.
Certain Offerings may require or allow you to create an additional, Offering-specific account. The terms of this Section 5 (and including any terms further set forth in the Documentation or Additional Terms for an Offering) will also apply to your creation, use and cancellation of such accounts.
If your Unity Account or any Offering-specific account is canceled, terminated or suspended, you and, if applicable, your Authorized Users, will lose the ability to access and use such Unity Account and any User Content that you have uploaded or stored using any Offering. Unity may immediately delete such User Content at the time of cancellation, termination or suspension of such Unity Account, and Unity will not be liable to you or any third party in connection with such deletion of your User Content or your loss of access and use of such Unity Account.
6. User Content
Your User Content is yours. Except as expressly granted to Unity under these Terms, you retain your ownership rights to User Content until you decide to transfer those rights.
7. Privacy
Unity’s Privacy Policy sets forth how Unity may collect, use, store and process personal information of or relating to you, and how you may request deletion of your personal information. For clarity, this includes personal information provided to Unity as part of any User Offering Data. You acknowledge that you have read and understand the Privacy Policy.
If you are Purchasing or using Unity Educational Grant License or Unity EdLab, you acknowledge that you have read and understand the Unity Educational Products for Schools Privacy Notice (“Educational Privacy Notice”). Notwithstanding the fact that only certain of our educational Offerings may collect personal data, you represent and warrant that you (i) have the legal authority to, and do consent to, the collection of personal information of your students, and (ii) have obtained all relevant legally required consents to the limited collection of personal information from your students, in each case in connection with providing such students with access to those educational Offerings for the purposes described in the Educational Privacy Notice.

You represent and warrant that, in connection with (a) any application that is directed to children under the age to consent to the processing of their personal information in their respective jurisdiction or is labeled or described as a “Kid’s” or “Children’s” application, or (b) any user who represents to you, such as through an age-gating mechanism, that he or she is under the age to consent to the processing of their personal information in their respective jurisdiction, you will not transmit to Unity any “Personal Information” as that term is defined under applicable law unless you have the authority to do so or have received a received a compliant verifiable parental consent for the collection of such information, Unity has a such a compliant solution available for the use of such information, or Unity’s use of the information is for internal operations excepted from the consent requirement. You agree to treat the data of those under 18 in a manner which is compliant with the jurisdiction within which your Project operates. You agree to indemnify and hold Unity harmless for any violation or alleged violations of child privacy laws, including but not limited to COPPA, with respect to Projects that you do not correctly or initially designate as “directed to children” as required by this section.
9. Payments
9.1. Fees
Fees and usage rates for certain Offerings are set forth within the Offering Identification. Unity may add or change fees, rates and charges for any of the Offerings from time to time by notifying you of such changes and/or posting such changes to the Offering Identification, which may include changes posted to the Site. Unity will provide you with prior notice of any changes affecting existing Offerings you have already started using, and your continued use of any Offering after the effective date of any such change means that you accept and agree to such changes.
You agree to pay all amounts due for the Offerings in accordance with the applicable Offering Identification and, if applicable, those of any payment processor. If you fail to make all payments when due, then Unity may suspend your access to or use of any Offerings in accordance with these Terms. Unless otherwise specified in an Offering Identification or the Additional Terms, (a) all payments under these Terms will be made in U.S. Dollars and (b) if the applicable Offering requires or allows you to elect to be invoiced monthly, you will pay all amounts in full no later than thirty (30) days from the date of invoice to the bank account designated by Unity.
Payments made under these Terms will be made without deduction or set-off for any withholding taxes, levies, imports, duties, charges and fees imposed by any governmental taxing authority except as required by law. If you are required to make any such deduction, then you will pay to Unity such additional amounts as are necessary to ensure Unity's receipt of the full amount that Unity would have received but for the deduction. You will be responsible for, and will promptly pay, all taxes, levies, imports, duties, charges and fees of any kind (including but not limited to sales, use and withholding taxes) associated with any Purchase of the Offerings, except for taxes based on Unity’s net income. In the event that Unity is required to collect any tax for which you are responsible, you will pay such tax directly to Unity or its payment processor. Unity reserves the right to collect any applicable sales, use or value added tax.
You acknowledge and agree that, in the case of certain Offerings, any estimates of fees and charges provided to you by Unity (for example, based on assumed data consumption) are solely estimates based on assumptions and that you are fully responsible for the actual fees and charges that accrue.
9.2. Billing
If you Purchase Offerings, then you will be asked to provide customary billing information, such as name, company name, billing address, credit card information, and VAT or GST number, either to Unity or its third party payment processor. VAT and GST numbers cannot be added or changed after the Purchase is processed. When you provide billing information to Unity or its third party payment processor, you (a) represent and warrant that you are the authorized user of the card, PIN, key or account associated with such billing information, (b) agree to pay Unity for all Purchases (including all applicable taxes) made via the Site, within the Offering or otherwise and (c) authorize Unity or its third party payment processor to charge your credit card or otherwise process your payment for any Purchase or other fees incurred by you. If you are directed to Unity’s third party payment processor, you may be subject to terms and conditions governing use of that third party’s service and that third party’s privacy policy. You will review such third party’s terms and conditions and privacy policy before using such services.
9.3. Subscription Term
Each subscription to an Offering is for a fixed, limited term, the length of which should be indicated at the time of Purchase on your Offering Identification. At the end of your subscription term for an Offering, your subscription will automatically renew at the then-current price and terms for the Offering, unless otherwise indicated to you in the Offering Identification. If you do not cancel any such subscription before the end of the current subscription term (or free trial period), your subscription will automatically renew (or your trial subscription will automatically convert to a paid subscription) for the subscription term disclosed to you in the Offering Identification. Unity will send you a reminder notice prior to the renewal date stating the subscription fee for and the length of the renewal term, and Unity will remind you of your right to cancel your subscription, how to do so, and that your subscription will renew if you do not cancel it. If your paid subscription automatically renews, you will be charged the subscription fee due for the next subscription term. Any statutory rights you may have under applicable law to cancel your subscription at an earlier time during the renewal term and to request a refund of the subscription fees for the unused part of the renewal period will remain unaffected by this provision.
10. Software
If you order Software or an Offering that includes Software (for example, if an Online Service Offering requires Software), the Software will be made available for download through your account or other electronic means or delivered to you by Unity or a Unity-authorized third party at Unity’s discretion.
During your subscription term, you may make one copy of the Software you subscribed to solely for your backup purposes. If you have purchased a node-locked subscription to Software, you may access and use such Software on the number of computers or operating systems per Authorized User as set forth in the Additional Terms and the Offering Identification. If you have purchased a floating subscription to Software, you may use such Software on multiple devices and share such Software among multiple Authorized Users, but the number of concurrent Authorized Users may not exceed your total number of floating subscriptions for the particular Software.
Any Software that Unity makes available or delivers to you is made available for your use for a limited subscription term, not sold, and you may not transfer or assign the Software, except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable law notwithstanding a contractual prohibition to the contrary. Your subscription to an Online Service does not grant to you any rights to the underlying Software used in providing the Online Service.
11. Online Services
If you subscribe to or access and use (as otherwise permitted by Unity) any Online Service, then Unity will provide those Online Services to you on the basis set forth in the Offering Identification. For example, if the Online Service is offered on a subscription basis, Unity will provide such Online Service to you for your subscription term, or if the Online Service is offered for a flat fee or on a pay-for-consumption basis, then Unity will provide such Online Service to you for so long as the amounts due are paid on a timely basis, in each subject to your compliance with these Terms and payment obligations.

If you choose to share or publish User Content, others may be able to use, sell, reproduce, modify, distribute, make available, display, transmit and communicate User Content. If you do not want that to happen, do not use the sharing, publishing or other collaboration features of the Offerings and set your permissions accordingly. Keep in mind that forums and galleries may be public, and submissions to them are generally public.
An Offering may feature links to third parties that offer services, software or other materials that complement such Offering. Such links are provided as a convenience to you. Unity does not monitor or control what such third parties will do with User Content or the Third-Party Materials made available through the services, software, or links. You are responsible for ensuring the appropriate level of access to User Content by any third party.

You agree not to disclose the Unity’s Confidential Information to any third party without Unity’s prior written consent, other than to Your employees, agents and consultants who need to know such information to carry out the purposes contemplated by these Terms and who are bound in writing by restrictions regarding disclosure and use of such information comparable to and no less restrictive than those set forth herein.
You agree to use at least the same degree of care to prevent unauthorized use and disclosure of Confidential Information as You use with respect to its own confidential information of like importance (but in no event less than a reasonable degree of care).
You may use or disclose Confidential Information to the extent (a) approved by Unity in writing or (b) You are legally compelled to disclose such Confidential Information provided, however, that prior to any such compelled disclosure, You shall give Unity reasonable advance notice of any such disclosure and shall cooperate with Unity in protecting against any such disclosure and/or obtaining a protective order narrowing the scope of such disclosure and/or use of the Confidential Information.
At any time at Unity’s request, You shall promptly return to Unity or destroy all materials (in written, electronic or other form) containing Unity’s Confidential Information, including any copies and extracts thereof, and so certify in writing to Unity. It is not a breach of the foregoing obligation to the extent Unity’s Confidential Information is contained in an electronic file created pursuant to Your routine backup or archiving procedures if such file is not easily deleted and is not generally accessible beyond the need for disaster recovery or similar operations.
18. Publicity
You authorize, and hereby grant the right and license to, Unity and its designees to use, reproduce, perform and display, and distribute and make available your trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, and other brand features for the purpose of advertising or publicizing the Offerings but not to brand the Offerings. The foregoing right is non-exclusive, transferable (in accordance with Section 23.9), worldwide, royalty-free and fully paid-up.
19. Unity Proprietary Rights
Unity and its licensors and service providers own all intellectual property and other rights with respect to (a) the Offerings, Documentation, the Site, Developer Services, and other information or material made available to you by or for Unity, including any copies of the foregoing, (b) the structure and organization, the underlying algorithms and other internals, the protocols, data structures and other externals, and the source code of any of the foregoing, and (c) any materials or other information based on, derived from or otherwise using any of the foregoing (including Usage Data and Reporting Data). You do not obtain any rights to the foregoing except as set forth in these Terms and hereby assign to Unity any rights in the foregoing.
You have only the rights expressly granted to you under these Terms (including any Commercial Terms or Additional Terms). All rights not expressly granted are reserved by Unity and its licensors and service providers. You agree not to take any action, or to authorize or encourage any third party to take any action (or cooperate with any third party in taking any action), inconsistent with the foregoing.
20. Disclaimers, Limitations on Liability
20.1. Limited Warranty
Other than as available under applicable law, Unity offers no further implied or statutory warranties or conditions with regard to the Offerings, and explicitly disclaims all implied warranties and conditions to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.
20.2. Disclaimers
THE OFFERINGS AND ANY DOCUMENTATION ARE ALL PROVIDED BY UNITY ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS, WITHOUT ANY REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, COVENANTS OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND. UNITY AND ITS LICENSORS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS DO NOT WARRANT OR REPRESENT THAT THE OFFERINGS AND ANY DOCUMENTATION, OR ANY PART THEREOF, WILL OPERATE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE. UNITY AND ITS LICENSORS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS (EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ORAL OR WRITTEN), WHETHER ALLEGED TO ARISE BY OPERATION OF LAW, BY REASON OF CUSTOM OR USAGE IN THE TRADE, BY COURSE OF DEALING OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING ANY AND ALL (A) WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, (B) WARRANTIES OF FITNESS OR SUITABILITY FOR ANY PURPOSE (WHETHER OR NOT UNITY KNOWS, HAS REASON TO KNOW, HAS BEEN ADVISED OR IS OTHERWISE AWARE OF ANY SUCH PURPOSE), AND (C) WARRANTIES OF NONINFRINGEMENT OR CONDITION OF TITLE. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED FROM UNITY OR ELSEWHERE WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY OR CONDITION NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS.
YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACCURACY AND QUALITY OF USER CONTENT, AND YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU MUST EVALUATE AND BEAR ALL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR USE OF THE OFFERINGS, DOCUMENTATION AND ANY THIRD-PARTY MATERIALS, OR YOUR RELIANCE ON THE ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS, OR USEFULNESS OF THE OFFERINGS, DOCUMENTATION AND ANY THIRD-PARTY MATERIALS. UNITY AND ITS LICENSORS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS HAVE NO OBLIGATION TO VERIFY THE IDENTITY OF USERS ACCESSING AND USING THE OFFERINGS, OR TO MONITOR THE USE OF OFFERINGS BY USERS. UNITY AND ITS LICENSORS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS DISCLAIM ALL LIABILITY FOR IDENTITY THEFT OR ANY OTHER MISUSE OF YOUR IDENTITY OR INFORMATION.
20.3. Limitations on Liability
Unity’s aggregate liability arising out of or relating to these Terms, any Offering or any Projects thereof or related Third-Party Materials or Documentation will not exceed the greater of (a) $1,000 or (b) the total fees paid or payable by you to Unity for the relevant Offering in the twelve (12) months before the dispute.
In no event will Unity or any licensors or service providers of Unity have any liability (directly or indirectly) for any incidental, special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages; loss of profits or revenue; business interruption or loss of use; cost of procurement of substitute goods or services or other cover; failure of or defects in any Projects or Third-Party Materials; loss, corruption or deletion of (or failure to delete) data or User Content; or damages resulting from Force Majeure.
The limitations on liability in these Terms will apply to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law to any damages or other liability, however caused and regardless of the theory of liability, whether based on contract, tort (including negligence and strict liability), indemnification, recourse, statute or otherwise, and even if Unity and its licensors and service providers have been advised of the possibility of the liability or the liability is otherwise foreseeable, and regardless of whether the limited remedies in these Terms fail of their essential purpose.
You acknowledge that the amounts payable for the Offerings are based in part on and reflective of the disclaimers of warranties and limitations on liability in these Terms and that such disclaimers and limitations are an essential element of the bargain between you and Unity.
Nothing in these Terms purports to restrict or exclude Unity’s liability for your damages or losses caused by Unity’s fraud, willful misconduct or gross negligence.
20.4. Relationship to Applicable Law
Unity does not seek to limit your warranties, other rights and remedies or the liability of Unity for damages or losses to the extent the limits are not permitted by applicable law (such as statutory warranties, conditions, remedies or liabilities that cannot be excluded by applicable law). Nothing in these Terms restricts the effect of warranties, the liability of Unity for damages or losses or other terms that cannot be excluded or otherwise modified under applicable law notwithstanding a contractual restriction to the contrary. These Terms give you specific legal rights, and you may also have other legal rights, which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. For example, some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages or other rights, so those provisions of these Terms may not apply to you. Some of these legal requirements are described in the "Country-Specific Terms" section.
21. Indemnity
You will indemnify and hold Unity harmless (and, at Unity’s request, defend Unity) against any and all losses, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) suffered or incurred by Unity by reason of any claim, suit or proceeding (“Claim”) arising out of or relating to (a) User Content, (b) your access to or use of Offerings, Documentation and Third-Party Materials, including any Projects, Developed Materials or other results produced by such use, (c) your breach or any acts or omissions that, if true, would be a breach of these Terms (including any Commercial Terms or Additional Terms), and (d) your breach or alleged breach of any applicable law or regulation.
At Unity’s option, you will assume control of the defense, but Unity retains the right to elect to take over defense at any time. You may not enter into a settlement under this clause without Unity’s prior written approval.
22. Term, Termination, Suspension
These Terms become effective on the first date accepted in accordance with the Acceptance section (Section 2) and continue in effect indefinitely unless terminated in accordance with this Term, Termination, Suspension section.
22.1. Your Right to Terminate
You may terminate these Terms if Unity is in material breach of these Terms and fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days after written notice of the breach.

These Terms will automatically terminate without further notice or action by Unity if you go into liquidation. Unity may also immediately disable or suspend your access to and use of Offerings and User Content if Unity believes in good faith that your conduct or failure to act, or User Content, may (i) pose a security risk or otherwise adversely impact Offerings, systems or other users, (ii) constitute or enable tampering with, removing, disabling or otherwise limiting the effectiveness of any technical protections, or (iii) subject Unity, any reseller or any other user to liability.
22.3. Effect of Termination of Subscription or Offering
Upon expiration or termination of a subscription or other Offering for any reason, your rights with respect to that Offering, including any related Software rights or Entitlements, will end. At that time, you will stop all access to and use of the Offering and uninstall any and all copies of materials related to such Offering (including any related Software, Documentation, Unity Materials or other material from Unity). In addition, at Unity’s request, you will destroy any such copies or return them to Unity or the reseller from which you acquired the Offering. You will retain proof that you returned or destroyed all such copies. You may no longer access any User Content that was previously submitted via the Offering, and Unity will have no obligation to maintain or forward such User Content. You will remain liable for all fees and charges owing for the Offering, and Unity will be entitled to deduct any outstanding charges from your billing account. If Unity suspends, disables or terminates your access to an Offering due to your breach, no refunds will be provided.
22.4. Effect of Termination of Terms
Upon any termination of these Terms for any reason, (a) your account and your subscriptions and other Offerings, including those of your Authorized Users, and all rights granted to you under these Terms will immediately terminate, and (b) the effects described above with respect to expiration or termination of a subscription or other Offering will apply to all subscriptions and other Offerings. Your payment obligations, your responsibility for anyone who has obtains, accesses or uses Offerings through you or your account, and the following sections of these Terms will survive termination for any reason: User Content (Section 6), Data (Section 7), Unity Materials (Section 12.3), Use of Third-Party Materials and Services (Section 12.4), Third Party Software (Section 12.5) Use of User Content (Section 12.6), Collaboration and Sharing of User Content (Section 12.7), Feedback (Section 15), Limitations on Use (Section 16), Confidentiality (Section 17), Unity Proprietary Rights (Section 19), Disclaimers, Limitations on Liability (Section 20), Indemnity (Section 21), Effect of Termination of Terms (Section 22.4), Miscellaneous (Section 23), Country-Specific Terms (Section 24) and Definitions (Section 25).
23. Miscellaneous
23.1. Changes to Offerings
You acknowledge that Unity may from time to time modify, discontinue, substitute or terminate an Offering (including any Entitlements), including during a paid subscription term, or add or modify license keys, authorizations or other means of controlling access to or use of the Offerings, when needed to comply with applicable law or regulation, or for justified commercial, security or operational reasons, including to make any improvements to access and use of the Offerings. Unity may change the price of an Offering, including the renewal price of a subscription as of the next renewal date, and we will provide you with prior notice if we do so. Prior to the effective date of your subscription renewal (which will be indicated in the notice provided to you), you can elect to cancel an automatic renewal for your subscription at any time and for any reason (including if you do not agree to a price change).
23.2. Changes to Terms
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Unity reserves the right from time to time to (and you acknowledge that Unity may) modify these Terms (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Additional Terms) without prior notice. If we modify these Terms, we will post the modification on the Site or otherwise provide you with notice of the modification. We will also update the “Last updated” date at the top of these Terms. By continuing to access or use the Offerings after we have provided you with notice of a modification, you agree to be bound by the modified Terms. If the modified Terms are not acceptable to you, your only recourse is to cease using the Services.
Notwithstanding this section, if the Additional Terms, Commercial Terms, Offering Identification, Documentation or Policies include different terms or procedures related to modification of those policies and terms, modification may, at Unity’s option, be handled as described in those policies and terms.
You acknowledge that your commitments with respect to the Offerings are not contingent on delivery of future features or functionality (or oral or written statements about future features or functionality).
23.3. Language of Terms; Interpretation
The English language version of these Terms will be the version used when interpreting or construing these Terms, and any notices or other communications in connection with these Terms will be provided in the English language. Any reference in these Terms to “days” are to calendar days unless otherwise specified. The words “including” and “for example” or “e.g.,” and words of similar import, are not limiting or exclusive and will be deemed followed by “without limitation,” whether or not such language is included. Section and other headings are for ease of reference only and are not to be used to interpret the meaning of any provision. Any rights and remedies provided for in these Terms are cumulative and are in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other rights and remedies available under applicable law.
23.4. Unity Party, Governing Law and Dispute Resolution
The governing law of these Terms will be the substantive laws of the State of California without regard to its conflicts of law principles.
Depending on your principal place of business or, if you are an individual, your place of residency, these Terms are between you and the Unity Contracting Party as specified below unless otherwise set forth in an Offering Identification or Commercial Terms. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply.
References to “Unity Contracting Party” refer to Unity Technologies ApS.
The parties are entering into these Terms as principal and not as agent of any person or entity. Nothing in these Terms shall constitute or be deemed to constitute any party as the agent or employee of the other party or any other person or entity for any purpose whatsoever. No party has the authority or power to bind the other party or any other person or entity, or to contract in the name of, or create a liability against, the other party or any other person or entity.
If your place of residency or principal place of business is in the United States:
Notwithstanding the choice of substantive law clause above, the parties agree that this contract concerns interstate commerce and that arbitration and this agreement to arbitrate will be governed by Title 9 (Arbitration) of the United States Code.
Except for disputes falling within the Arbitration Exceptions set out below, any dispute arising out of, relating to or in connection with these Terms (including any disputes regarding the existence, validity, interpretation, performance, breach or termination thereof or any dispute regarding non-contractual obligations arising out of or relating to be) will be referred to and finally resolved by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules. The seat of arbitration will be the City and County of San Francisco, California. The number of arbitrators will be three with the claimant party nominating one arbitrator, the respondent party nominating one arbitrator and the third and presiding arbitrator being nominated by the two party appointed arbitrators within 30 days of the appointment of the second arbitrator. The language of arbitration will be English. Except in respect of disputes falling within the Arbitration Exceptions set out below, the parties agree that they are each waiving the right to a trial by jury. The arbitration award will be final and binding on the parties. Judgment upon the award may be entered by any court having jurisdiction of the award or having jurisdiction over the relevant party or its assets.
The Parties agree that any arbitration will be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the Parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. YOU AND UNITY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If there is a determination that any term in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason as to any claim, then the arbitration provision set forth above will be inapplicable as to that claim, and that claim will instead proceed through litigation in court rather than by arbitration, but only after the conclusion of the arbitration of any claim or dispute subject to the parties’ arbitration agreement.
If your place of residency or principal place of business is outside the United States:
References to the governing law refer to:

If you habitually reside in a Member State of the European Union or the EEA, the United Kingdom or Switzerland, and are acting as a consumer (i.e., for a purpose which can be regarded as outside your trade craft or profession), the foregoing choice of governing law will not deprive you of the protection afforded to you by provisions that cannot be derogated from by agreement by virtue of the laws applicable where you habitually reside. In addition, you may bring proceedings in relation to any claim against Unity either in the courts of the country in which Unity is domiciled or in the courts for the place where you are domiciled, and proceedings may be brought against you only in the courts of the country in which you are domiciled.
Any dispute arising out of, relating to or in connection with these Terms (including any disputes regarding the existence, validity, interpretation, performance, breach or termination thereof or any dispute regarding non-contractual obligations arising out of or relating to be) will be referred to and finally resolved by binding arbitration as follows:

Interim Relief and Arbitration Exceptions
Notwithstanding the agreement to arbitrate above, or the provisions of any applicable arbitration rules, the Parties agree that:
(a) if your place of residency or principal place of business is in the United States, Unity may bring an action in court, including, without limitation, to seek injunctive relief, to enforce its intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights.
(b) regardless of your place of residency or principal place of business, either Party may seek temporary, preliminary or other expedited or provisional injunctive relief (but not money damages) from any court of competent jurisdiction pending the constitution of an arbitral tribunal. A request by a Party to a court of competent jurisdiction for interim measures necessary to preserve the Parties’ rights, including pre-arbitration attachments or injunctions, will not be deemed incompatible with, or a waiver of, this agreement to arbitrate. (together with (a), the “Arbitration Exceptions”)
In the event that a particular dispute is deemed not arbitrable under any relevant applicable law or in the event that a dispute arises falling within the Arbitration Exceptions, then the Parties agree that any such dispute will be referred to and determined by the courts of the jurisdiction of the relevant applicable law and the Parties irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts.
23.5. Compliance
Unity has the right to verify the installation of, access to, and use of any Offerings by you and your Authorized Users. You may not take any steps to avoid or defeat the purpose of any such verification measures. You will within ten (10) days of Unity or its authorized representative’s request provide all pertinent records and information requested in order to verify that your installation of, access to and use of any Offerings by you and your Authorized Users is in compliance with these Terms along with a signed verification that all such information is complete and correct. As part of any such verification, Unity or its authorized representative has the right, on ten (10) days’ prior notice (in electronic form or otherwise), to inspect your records, systems and facilities, on your premises to review and verify your compliance with these Terms. Any such inspection will be conducted during regular business hours at your facilities or electronically via remote access using a Unity-approved verification tool. If Unity determines that your installation of, access to, or use of any Offering is not in conformity with these Terms (including any Commercial Terms, Additional Terms or other applicable terms) or you have not paid the applicable fees for all Offerings you have used, you will immediately pay for such Offerings, as well as Unity’s reasonable costs of the verification. Unity reserves the right to seek any other remedies available at law or in equity.
23.6. Trade Control Laws
You, your directors, employees, contractors, and Affiliates will comply with all applicable U.S. laws and regulations on export, import, economic sanctions, and antiboycott, including but not limited to: the Export Administration Regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security); the Foreign Trade Regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of the Census, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection regulations administered by the U.S Department of Homeland Security; the International Traffic in Arms Regulations administered by the U.S. Department of State's Directorate of Defense Trade Controls; economic sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control; and applicable laws and regulations on export, import, economic sanctions, and antiboycott outside the United States where you, your directors, employees, contractors, and Affiliates conduct business (collectively, “Trade Controls”). You will comply with, and be solely responsible for compliance with, all applicable Trade Controls related to your access to and use of Offerings and your Projects and User Content, and you will establish and maintain controls, policies and procedures to comply with applicable Trade Controls.
You confirm that none of you, your directors, employees, contractors, or Affiliates: (a) are individuals or entities identified on, or owned or controlled by or acting on behalf of entities identified on applicable Trade Controls restricted party lists (such as the List of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons, Foreign Sanctions Evaders List, Denied Persons List, Unverified List, and Entity List) (collectively, “Restricted Parties”), (b) are entities owned or controlled by one or more Restricted Parties, (c) do business in countries or regions subject to comprehensive Trade Controls, including Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, and the Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine, (“Sanctioned Countries”) or with government-affiliated entities in Sanctioned Countries, or (d) Will engage in or facilitate any activities with Sanctioned Countries or Restricted Parties.
Neither you, your directors, employees, contractors, or Affiliates, will (i) engage in or facilitate activities directly or indirectly related to any end-uses that are restricted by Trade Controls (including but not limited to nuclear, missiles, chemical or biological weapons end-uses) or (ii) export, re-export, store, host or otherwise transfer your data (or data made available to you), information, services or other activities subject to any applicable export licensing requirement or authorization under Trade Controls without obtaining the appropriate export license or authorization, and will at all times comply with the terms and conditions of such export licenses and authorizations. Upon the request of Unity, you will notify Unity of the applicable export control classifications applicable to your products, software and technology, and any export licenses or authorizations.
23.7. Government Rights
To the extent you or any of your Authorized Users are government entities, the following terms apply:
The Unity Offerings and all associated Documentation are “commercial computer software” and related commercial “computer software documentation” as those terms are defined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (“FAR”) 2.101 and U.S. Department of Defense (“DoD”) FAR Supplement (“DFARS”) 252.227-7014(a) or similar provisions effective in the applicable jurisdiction, and thus are subject to the policies and requirements of FAR 12.212 or, for DoD, DFARS 227.7202, or similar applicable policies or requirements. All government entities shall acquire the Offering and all associated Documentation or other related technical data subject to these Terms as required in FAR 12.212 (Computer Software) or DFARS 227.7202 and their respective successors, as applicable, except to the limited extent a government end user is prohibited by the laws of its jurisdiction from accepting such terms. If and to the extent any provision of these Terms is so prohibited, such provisions will be deemed modified only to the extent reasonably necessary to conform to applicable law, but to give maximum effect to the Terms as written. This Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFARS, or other clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer software or technical data.
23.8. Assignment
These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you without Unity’s prior written consent, and any attempt to do so in breach of the foregoing will be null and void. Unity may assign these Terms and delegate its obligations under these Terms at any time and without notice.
23.9. Severability
If and to the extent any provision of these Terms is held unenforceable under applicable law, (a) such provision will be deemed modified to the extent reasonably necessary to conform to applicable law but to give maximum effect to the intent of the parties set forth in these Terms, and (b) such provision will be ineffective only as to the jurisdiction in which it is held unenforceable without affecting enforceability in any other jurisdiction.
23.10. Notices

For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.
23.11. Entire Agreement; No Waiver
These Terms, including all exhibits and any Commercial Terms and Additional Terms (which are incorporated by reference in these Terms), constitute the entire agreement between you and Unity (and merge and supersede any prior or contemporaneous agreements, discussions, communications, representations, warranties, advertising or understandings) with respect to the subject matter hereof. Any access to or use of an Offering is expressly conditioned on the application of these Terms, and any other terms are expressly rejected.
If there is any conflict between these Terms of Service and any Additional Terms, the Additional Terms will control in relation to their subject matter. If there is any conflict between these Terms of Service or the Additional Terms and the Commercial Terms, the Commercial Terms will control in relation to its subject matter to the extent set forth in the Commercial Terms.

Any terms or conditions contained in your purchase order or other ordering document that are inconsistent with or in addition to these Terms are hereby rejected by Unity and will be deemed null.

23.12. Intellectual Property
23.12.1. Copyright Policy
Unity respects copyright law and expects its users to do the same. Unity has adopted and implemented a policy that provides for the termination in appropriate circumstances of registered users or other account holders who repeatedly infringe or are believed to be repeatedly infringing the rights of copyright holders.
